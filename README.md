# Blockfolio

A simple Ipython Notebook to display your crypto asset net worth.

This is a simple "Blockfolio" using Python and the [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).

It will show the net worth in USD of your Cryptocurrency investments as well as the relative share
of coins you own in comparison to the total coin supply of the corresponding digital asset.

First, the current exchanges rates are loaded, then combined with your investments,
and finally displayed using Plotly.
